      <strong>Tomato products:</strong> You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato
      sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.

      <strong>Cheeses:</strong> Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra
      decadent.

      <strong>Egg:</strong> An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna
      when you cut into it.
